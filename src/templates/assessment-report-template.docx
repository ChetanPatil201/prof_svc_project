## 3. Total Azure Cost Per Month

The following table provides a comprehensive cost comparison across different Azure pricing models:

| Pricing Plan | Config Match | Recurring/Month - Compute | Recurring/Month - Storage | Total Azure Cost Per Month |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| On-demand | PAYG | ${{payAsYouGoCompute}} | ${{payAsYouGoStorage}} | ${{payAsYouGoTotal}} |
| Reserved Instance (1-Year) | 1-Year | ${{reservedInstance1YrCompute}} | ${{reservedInstance1YrStorage}} | ${{reservedInstance1YrTotal}} |
| Reserved Instance (3-Year) | 3-Year | ${{reservedInstance3YrCompute}} | ${{reservedInstance3YrStorage}} | ${{reservedInstance3YrTotal}} |

### Cost Optimization Summary:

## 7. Detailed Server Analysis

### In-Scope Servers:
{{#inScopeServers}}
- **{{machine}}**: {{operatingSystem}} | Cores: {{cores}} | Memory: {{memoryMb}} MB | Storage: {{storageGb}} GB
{{/inScopeServers}}

### Operating System Distribution:
{{#osDistributionTable}}
- **{{os}}**: {{count}} servers
{{/osDistributionTable}}

## 8. Recommendations and Next Steps

### Migration Strategy:
1. **Phase 1**: Migrate {{phase1Servers}} servers with high readiness scores
2. **Phase 2**: Address compatibility issues for {{phase2Servers}} servers
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize and right-size remaining workloads

### Cost Optimization Recommendations:
- Consider Reserved Instances for long-term workloads
- Implement Azure Hybrid Benefit for eligible Windows Server licenses
- Use Azure Spot Instances for non-critical workloads
- Optimize storage tiers based on access patterns

### Risk Mitigation:
- Implement comprehensive backup and disaster recovery
- Establish monitoring and alerting for migrated workloads
- Plan for network connectivity and security requirements
- Consider application dependencies and migration order
